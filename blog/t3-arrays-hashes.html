<p>What is an Array, or a Hash for that matter? What are they used for? Where can I buy vegetable soup? All of these questions answers.
An array is a way of storing information in an ordered fashion. If you imagine a set of shelves that allow you to store one item of any kind on each level. Each shelf is numbered started from 0 so that when you direct someone to collect that item they know exactly where to go for the object. You populate the shelfs from 0 to as high a number as you feel. <br />
A hash on the other hand is a similar solution, except each shelf has a space for a label where you can give it a name. Instead of shelf zero you can use a shelf named “onion” to indicate what is stored there. <br />
Why would you use an array vs a hash. Arrays are helpful for when you have a collection of information to process, such as a series of numbers or words. Hashes are useful for storing properties. For example you might have an object called soup with a hash symbol for vegetable stating true. There’s your vegetable soup.</p>
